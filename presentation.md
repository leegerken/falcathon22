# 2022 Falcathon
Hosted by the Linux Club

---

# Who Am I?

---

Lee - Philosophy

I like linux because I like good software.

---

##Favorite Program: vim


I like working in the terminal.

---

# What is my project?

---

You are currently experiencing it!

Half of it.

---

I wasted a lot of time with this dumb thing.

---

## 90% Presentation
# 10% The Program

---

But I learned a lot!

---

pip install lookatme

---

# Tools I Used

---

- Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+

- A CRT Television

---

- bash, openssh,  /boot/config.txt
ncurses, c, dwm, st, X, xinitrc.

---

# Improvements

---

Probably don't need dwm.

Straight to X

---

Knowing C would help.

---

Not very distributable.

Very specific setup.

---

# What I learned

---

## SSH + PI + TV + NCURSES

Surprisingly fast, fun dev environment.

---

## DWM
## Fonts are helpful

---

## devious licks

Overscan,
OpenBSD + University Wifi

---

# Things I Didn't Understand

---

## python

## patching DWM

## DWM refusal to just simply open a terminal window that properly fills the screen. Yes I know there are simpler Tiling Window Managers out there but opening a terminal window is such a common action, why is it such a pain out of the box? I tried installing a fullscreen patch but even that was trying; why was it trying to patch my config.def.h file? Isn't that supposed to stay unchanged? Could someone just explain to me what the heck is going on with managing git with dwm?? LORD. 

---

# Project and Presentation Files are on my github

---

If I knew how to use github.
